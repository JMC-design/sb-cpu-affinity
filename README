SB-CPU-AFFINITY is a simple API to Linux scheduler affinity masks for SBCL.

See documentation of symbols exported from SB-CPU-AFFINITY package.

Usage example:

  (with-cpu-affinity-mask (mask)
    (print mask))

  (with-cpu-affinity-mask (mask :save t)
    ;; Remove all
    (clear-cpu-affinity-mask mask)
    ;; Set CPU 0.
    (setf (cpu-affinity-p 0 mask) t))
 
  (with-cpu-affinity-mask (mask)
    (print mask))

  (with-cpu-affinity-mask (mask :save t)
    ;; Only odd CPUs in mask.
    (dotimes (cpu (cpu-count))
      (setf (cpu-affinity-p cpu mask) (oddp cpu))))
  
  (with-cpu-affinity-mask (mask)
    (print mask))
